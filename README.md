This project aims to predict gold prices using historical data and a machine learning model. I used a Random Forest Regressor from the scikit-learn library, along with data analysis and visualization tools like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Gold is a valuable commodity, and its price is influenced by various market and economic factors. This project uses historical data to build a predictive model that can estimate future gold prices.
The key steps in this project include:
1.Data loading and preprocessing
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Building a machine learning model
4.Evaluating model performance
5.Visualizing actual vs predicted prices

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Python
pandas â€“ for data manipulation
NumPy â€“ for numerical operations
matplotlib & seaborn â€“ for visualizations
scikit-learn â€“ for building and evaluating the ML model

ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Model
I used the Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

Model evaluation metrics:
1.RÂ² Score: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
2.Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average error between actual and predicted values.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
1.The Random Forest model performed well in predicting gold prices.
2.The predicted prices closely matched the actual trends in the test data.
