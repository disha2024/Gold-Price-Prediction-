This project aims to predict gold prices using historical data and a machine learning model. I used a Random Forest Regressor from the scikit-learn library, along with data analysis and visualization tools like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

📌 Project Overview
Gold is a valuable commodity, and its price is influenced by various market and economic factors. This project uses historical data to build a predictive model that can estimate future gold prices.
The key steps in this project include:
1.Data loading and preprocessing
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Building a machine learning model
4.Evaluating model performance
5.Visualizing actual vs predicted prices

🔧 Technologies Used

 🖥️ Programming Language
- Python 3

📦 Python Libraries
- Flask – for creating the web application
- NumPy – for numerical operations

📈 Results
1.The Random Forest model performed well in predicting gold prices.

2.The predicted prices closely matched the actual trends in the test data.
